# PlantGuard: Plant Species Management System

## Description

**PlantGuard** is a Java-based application designed to manage and authenticate plant species. It provides an easy way to add, list, and manage plant data, along with a simple authentication system to ensure only authorized users can access and manipulate plant information. This project is aimed at helping environmentalists, botanists, or any users working with plant species data to securely store and retrieve information about various plant species.

### Key Features:

- **Plant Management**: Add, list, and search plant species.
- **Authentication**: A simple user authentication system to secure access to plant data.
- **Debugging and Logging**: Detailed debugging logs for easy troubleshooting and system tracking.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Maven for dependency management (optional)

## Project Structure

### main/

- **PlantService.java**: Contains the logic for managing plant-related operations such as adding, listing, and updating plants.
- **Plant.java**: Represents a plant entity with properties like scientific name, common name, and habitat.
- **User.java**: Defines a user with authentication details.
- **UserService.java**: Contains the logic for managing users, such as authentication and user-related actions.
- **Logger.java**: Utility class for logging debug information and errors.

### resources/
